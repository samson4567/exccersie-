[6:17 Mr Wisdom: Write function that translates a text to Pig Latin and back. English is translated to Pig Latin by taking the first letter of every word, moving it to the end of the word and adding ‘ay’. “The quick brown fox” becomes “Hetay uickqay rownbay oxfay”.
[6:21 AM, 10/13/2022] Mr Wisdom: hint: you need to know if a number is a prime number.

you should do a for loop from 0 to 10,000,000 and print if the value is a prime number
[6:23 AM, 10/13/2022] Mr Wisdom: hint, you can figure out how to calculate the difference between leap years and then use a while loop print each.
increment a number every time you print, and when the number gets to 20 you can end the while loop
